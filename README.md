# Console AI Chat

This is a console based AI Chat I am using to get more familiar with agentic workflows and vector databases.

This includes a simple docker-compose file to start a postgres and a qdrant database. 

Current Features:
* Chat Completion in the Console with multiple Tools for the AI to access

Current Tools/Plugins
* Plugin for the AI to access the postgres DB
* Plugin for the AI to safely execute javascript code.
